### Developed for Extensibility

Out of the box, Photography Portfolio is built using Masonry Layout.
Quite simply - it's the layout most easily portable to any website layout while keeping the feel of the brand.

For some, a masonry layout might not be enough, it sure isn't enough for our Photography WordPress themes, because of that, this plugin is packed with Actions and Filters. Not only in PHP but also the JavaScript side.

You can easily extend the plugin with your own custom archive and single-view layouts. Customization is easy as Photography Portfolio plugin templates are based on `get_template_part()` function, similar to the way WooCommerce plugin has a custom template function. That brings a lot of customization power to the table. Pick any part of the view, and append your own template bits or completely rewrite the templates.

The JavaScript side is also easily extensible.
You can use filters and actions based on [WP-JS-Hooks](https://github.com/carldanley/WP-JS-Hooks) to either modify the existing functionality, for example modifying the core masonry layout just a bit or completely initialize a brand new layout (like Packery or Horizontal Scroll). If you decide to build a custom view, you can utilize the existing JavaScript hook structure to let the plugin handle all the little things for you.

### WordPress Themes

We also build premium [WordPress themes for Photographers](https://colormelon.com). Have a look at our *Portfolio* and maybe you fall in love with one of them!
Because our business is to build WordPress themes, **this is not "Photography Portfolio Lite"** with a billion up-sells. This is a fully featured Photography Portfolio plugin with albums, images, categories, a Pop-up gallery and even video support.
We respect our users and believe that one can recognize quality on their own, without being bombarded with constant "buy extra functionality" junk. We know we build awesome *ship*, now you know it too. You can have a look at our premium stuff when you feel like it, if not - that's cool too. Especially if you're just starting out, you might have to cut some corners and bootstrap everything on your own, and even then, we truly believe this plugin is going to do wonders for you! Pick a simple minimalistic theme, install the plugin, and enjoy a clean portfolio website that you can grow on your own!
